# Setting Up Your Environment

To use [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Carbon](https://github.com/sage/carbon) with your local environment we recommend you use Node and npm.

## Installing Node and npm

Download and install the LTS version of Node from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/), or install and use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

*Note:* If you already have Node installed, make sure you're using the latest stable version - [you can download it here](https://nodejs.org)

### Check npm version

Make sure you are on Version 6.x by running `npm -v`. To upgrade your version of npm run `npm install npm -g`

### Check permissions

If you are getting permission issues when you install modules using npm, you may need to change the permission of your npm directory. Follow the instructions on [npm's website](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions). You should not need to use `sudo` to install modules.
